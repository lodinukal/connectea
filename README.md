- Adds a button to calculate the TEA for ATAR subjects and orders them by contribution to the TEA.
- Allows for custom scaling information to be entered.
- Allows for custom target percentages to be set and for next assessment averages to be calculated based on the remaining weightings.
- Automatically expands the assessment outlines to show all assessments within all subjects.

# Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect any personal data, does not make any web requests, and only uses code from within the extension source code (https://github.com/lodinukal/connectea). It only interacts with the already client sided loaded data from the connect site to display the chart information in a more user friendly way as opposed having to open the developer console to view the data.
