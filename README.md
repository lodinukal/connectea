Loads chart information by hooking the highcharts library, and displays it within the connect site.

# Functionality
- Adds quartile information to all charts in assessment outlines.
- Adds a button to calculate the unscaled TEA for ATAR subjects and orders them by contribution to the TEA.

# Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect any personal data, does not make any web requests, and only uses code from within the extension source code (https://github.com/lodinukal/connectea). It only interacts with the already client sided loaded data from the connect site to display the chart information in a more user friendly way as opposed having to open the developer console to view the data.
